# NTron Game

A retro game for the VHS LED wall with similarities to games like Tron and Caterpillar/Snake. Runs on Teensy 3.1 with a 32x24
grid of WS2812 (NeoPixel) RGB LEDs.

Differences are:
* Two player game.
* You can choose when to lay a fence behind you.
* You can fire rockets!
* Both actions use energy, which is generated slowly over time, and quickly if you eat a rainbow-coloured powerup pixel.
* Power bars for both players are shown along the bottom row of pixels.
